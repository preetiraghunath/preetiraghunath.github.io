            <p>I am Preeti Raghunath, <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/spir/people/academic/preeti-raghunath" class="link">Lecturer</a> in Digital Media and Society at the University of Sheffield, UK. Over the past decade, I have traversed academic landscapes in India, Malaysia and the UK. During this time, my theoretical and empirical research has focused on media/technology policies and their making by taking a long view as well as centring lived experiences. My teaching practice has involved teaching, programme direction and research supervision as part of UG, PG and doctoral programmes with an interdisciplinary approach to communication and media, broadly put.</p>

            <p>I am driven by curiosity, value learning and growth, like understanding people's creative-academic processes, and immensely enjoy partaking in the enterprise of knowledge. My PhD was an ethnography of media policies and policymaking in South Asia, published as a <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-5629-6" class="link">book</a> in 2020. In the years after, my research has focused on data governance in India, AI Policies and Gender in Southeast Asia, and on AI Safety. I currently co-lead a UKRI-SSHRC KSG project on 'Weaving an AI Safety Net for UK and Canada' (website to be available soon). I have edited four collections on media and technology policies and practices in the Global South. I am now working on my second book on 'Global Approaches to AI and Data' (under contract, BUP). I am a co-editor of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/series/14699" class="link">Palgrave Global Media Policy and Business</a> book series and serve on the Editorial Boards of Critical Policy Studies and the Journal of Digital Media and Policy.</a></p>

            <p>I enjoy reading fiction/nonfiction and writing creative nonfiction, watching films, theatre and live performances in the languages I follow. I serve as a Trustee of Utopia Theatre at Sheffield, UK.</p>
