            <p>I am Preeti Raghunath, <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/spir/people/academic/preeti-raghunath" class="link">Lecturer</a> in Digital Media and Society at the University of Sheffield, UK. Over the past decade, I have traversed academic landscapes in India, Malaysia and the UK. During this time, my theoretical and empirical research has focused on media/technology policies and their making by taking a long view as well as centring lived experiences. My teaching practice has involved teaching, programme direction and research supervision as part of UG, PG and doctoral programmes with an interdisciplinary approach to communication and media, broadly put.</p>

            <p>I am driven by curiosity, value learning and growth, like understanding people's creative-academic processes, and immensely enjoy partaking in the enterprise of knowledge. My first large-scale research project was for my PhD where I conducted an expansive media policy ethnography in South Asia, published as a <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-5629-6" class="link">book</a> in 2020. In the years after, I have edited four collections on media and technology policies in the Global South. I am a co-editor of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/series/14699" class="link">Palgrave Global Media Policy and Business</a> book series and serve on the Editorial Board of the <a href="https://www.intellectbooks.com/journal-of-digital-media-policy" class="link">Journal of Digital Media and Policy.</a></p>

            <p>I enjoy reading some poetry and a lot of prose, and hope to write for non-academic readers in the future. I also like watching films, theatre and live performances in the languages I follow. I serve on the boards of the Oral History Association of India (OHAI) and Utopia Theatre at Sheffield, UK.</p>
